## Overview

"Never Split the Difference" by Chris Voss is a masterclass in negotiation techniques derived from high-stakes hostage negotiations. Voss, a former FBI hostage negotiator, translates his field-tested methods into practical strategies for everyday negotiations in business and personal life.

## Key Concepts

### Tactical Empathy
The foundation of effective negotiation is understanding the other party's perspective without necessarily agreeing with it. This involves active listening and acknowledging emotions to build rapport.

### The Power of "No"
Contrary to popular belief, getting a "no" response is often the beginning of real negotiation. It allows the other party to feel in control and opens the door for further discussion.

### Calibrated Questions
These are open-ended questions that start with "what" or "how" and force the other party to think and provide information. They give you control without confrontation.

### Mirroring
Repeating the last few words someone says creates a psychological connection and encourages them to elaborate, revealing more information.

### Labeling
Identifying and vocalizing emotions helps defuse them and shows understanding, which can shift the dynamic of the conversation.

## Practical Applications

The techniques in this book are particularly valuable for:
- Salary negotiations
- Business deals
- Conflict resolution
- Customer service
- Personal relationships

## Impact on My Approach
