Bitcoin is hard to understand because it involves different fields of knowledge: **economy, technology, philosophy and incentives**. But I will try my best to explain a few bullet points so maybe I can awake the curiosity on you, and also I'll give you some resources in case you want to know further.

First of all, let's talk about **economy**, what do the current currencies like dollar and euro have to say vs. Bitcoin.

<h4>Inflation</h4>

![blog-cover](/images/blog/2025-07-25-bitcoin/inflation.jpg)
- <p>$100 in 1913 would only be worth about $3.87 today. That means that in around 100 years the dollar has lost 96.13% of its value <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://howmuch.net/articles/rise-and-fall-dollar">[1]</a>.</p>
- <p>While the purchasing power of the dollar has gone up and down since 1913, it has never surpassed the purchasing power it had in 1913.</p>
- <p>Inflation slowly eats the value that you have generated, making your savings worth less every year.</p>

<p>Understanding why this happens is a bit complex, but to summarize, what happens is that the central banks print money, at a more or less steady pace. But specially in bellic times, money is printed particularly fast, devouring people's savings, at the same time that this new printed money is used to finance wars.</p>

<h4>Gold pattern vs Fiat money</h4>
<p>The economic depression of the 1930s made countries enter a loop in which they would devaluate their currency (to promote exports) and push protectionist measures (to limit imports) that ultimately worsened the crisis by deterring international trade.</p>
<p>After years, the developed countries took notice of this detrimental loop, and the presidents held a meeting, and signed the Bretton Woods Agreements in 1944.</p>
<p>The <b>Bretton Woods Agreements</b> created a new international monetary system <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">[2]</a>. In this new system:</p>

- Dollar was the central currency, and the only currency that was convertible to gold (at an exchange rate of gold at $35 per ounce)
 
- All other currencies had a fixed rate to the dollar but could not be converted to gold (you needed first to convert your currency to dollar, and then you could convert your dollars into gold)

<p>The system worked fairly well for some years, but soon, both USA and the other countries started taking advantage of the system:</p>

- USA started printing more dollars, than those that they could back up with the gold they had

- Some allied countries tried to take advantage of the system by keeping their currencies undervalued to boost exports to the USA, causing trading surpluses. This worsened U.S. deficits and pressured dollar, contributing to the system's collapse.

<p>Both sides tried to take advantage of the system, and this is what led the system to collapse. What happened is that France with President Charles de Gaulle in 1965 was suspicious about the system and started to demand their dollars to be converted into gold to the USA.</p>
<p>This intensified during the next years, as other countries also started asking for gold to USA. And in year 1971 Richard Nixon stopped the convertibility of the U.S. dollar to gold.</p>

<h4>What does Bitcoin have to say in regards to the economy</h4>
<p>As we just saw, since 1971 that Nixon deattached dollar to gold, fiat currencies are not convertible to gold, and therefore they are backend by nothing. You cannot go to the bank and ask your currency to get transformed into gold, it doesn't work like that anymore since 1971.</p>
<p>Therefore, fiat currencies are not backed on anything, they are just papers, that as we saw, the central banks can just print more of it, hence making your bills worth less and less.</p>
<p>Another way to see this, is that fiat money, has no intrinsic value as it is not based on anything anymore. It is only based on the state's violence, since if you don't pay your taxes you will be taken to jail.</p>
<p>Bitcoin is said to be based on nothing, well as we just saw, nowadays fiat money is also based on nothing. So, does either bitcoin or fiat money have intrinsic value? The answer is that none of them have intrinsic value</p>
<p>But why then would I invest on bitcoin, if it has no intrinsic value? So the answer that I could give about that, is that in the same way that fiat money is backed by the state's violence, bitcoin is based on electricity. To sustain the network, an incredibly high amount of hashrate has been put into mining the bitcoin blocks, and in a way all of that electricity is what gives bitcoin its "intrinsic" value. To put it in that way, it's like transforming energy and electrity of the real world, into value in the abstract world <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IFcOIEfl4">[3]</a>.</p>
