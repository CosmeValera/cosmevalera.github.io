Bitcoin is hard to understand because it involves different fields of knowledge: **economy, technology, philosophy and incentives**. But I will try my best to explain a few bullet points so maybe I can make you curious about this topic, and also I'll give you some resources in case you want to know further.

First of all, let's talk about **economy**, how do current currencies like the dollar and euro compare to Bitcoin?

---

<h4>Inflation</h4>

![blog-cover](/images/blog/2025-07-25-bitcoin/inflation.jpg)

- <p>$100 in 1913 would only be worth about $3.87 today. That means that in around 100 years the dollar has lost 96.13% of its value <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://howmuch.net/articles/rise-and-fall-dollar">[1]</a>.</p>
- <p>While the purchasing power of the dollar has gone up and down since 1913, it has never surpassed the purchasing power it had in 1913.</p>

<p>Understanding why inflation happens is a bit complex, but to summarize: central banks print money, at a more or less steady pace. However, during periods of war or conflict, this money creation accelerates significantly. As a result, people's savings lose value, while the new printed money is often used to fund wars.</p>

<h4>From the Gold Standard to Fiat money</h4>
<p>The economic depression of the 1930s made countries enter a loop in which they would devaluate their currency (to promote exports) and push protectionist measures (to limit imports) that ultimately worsened the crisis by deterring international trade.</p>
<p>After years, 44 countries, including the USA, recognized this detrimental loop, and the presidents held a meeting where they signed the Bretton Woods Agreements in 1944.</p>
<p>The <b>Bretton Woods Agreements</b> created a new international monetary system <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/brettonwoodsagreement.asp">[2]</a>. In this new system:</p>

- The dollar became the central currency and the only one convertible to gold (at an exchange rate of $35 per ounce).
 
- All other currencies had fixed exchange rates to the dollar but were not directly convertible to gold (they had to be converted to dollars first, and then to gold).

<p>The system worked fairly well for some years, but eventually, both the USA and the other countries started taking advantage of the system:</p>

- The USA started printing more dollars than those that they could back up with its gold reserves.

- Some of the other 43 countries kept their currencies undervalued to boost exports to the USA, causing trading surpluses. This worsened U.S. deficits and pressured the dollar, contributing to the system's collapse.

<p>Both sides tried to take advantage of the system, and this finally led the system to collapse. In 1965, France, under President Charles de Gaulle, grew suspicious about the system and demanded the USA to convert France's dollar reserves into gold.</p>
<p>This trend intensified as other countries also started requesting for gold to the USA. In 1971, President Richard Nixon ended the dollar's convertibility to gold.</p>

<h4>Bitcoin vs. Fiat Currency</h4>
<p>As we just saw, since Nixon detached de dollar from gold in 1971, fiat currencies are no longer convertible to gold; therefore, they are no longer backed by anything. You can't go to a bank and exchange your currency for gold, it doesn't work like that anymore.</p>
<p>As a result, fiat currencies are just paper bills, which, as we've seen, central banks can print more at will, thus making your money worth less and less.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is that fiat money has no intrinsic value, since it is no longer backed by anything. It is only based on the state's violence, since if you don't pay your taxes, you will be taken to jail.</p>
<p>People often say Bitcoin is based on nothing. Well, as we just saw, nowadays fiat money is also based on nothing. So, does either Bitcoin or fiat money have intrinsic value? The answer is: neither does.</p>
<p><b>But why, then, would I invest in bitcoin</b> if it has no intrinsic value? The answer is that, in the same way that fiat money is backed by the state's violence, Bitcoin is backed by electricity. Maintaining the network requires an enormous amount of computational power (hashrate) to mine blocks. In a way, all of that electricity is what gives bitcoin its "intrinsic" value. To put it in that way, it's like transforming the energy of the real world into value in the digital world <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--IFcOIEfl4">[3]</a>.</p>

<p>We saw a bit of economy, let's see some <b>technology</b> and <b>incentives</b> in Bitcoin.</p>
<h4>Basics of bitcoin technology</h4>

![blog-cover](/images/blog/2025-07-25-bitcoin/technology.png)
<p>Bitcoin is both a network and a currency. <b>Bitcoin</b> with upper 'B' is for the network, and <b>bitcoin</b> with lower 'b' is for the currency.</p>

<p>Bitcoin as a network is based on maths and code. For Bitcoin to work, it is based on its technology and its incentives, which both work in a synergic way for the network to operate <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>When bitcoin was creted there were two key problems that needed to be fix, for a working network peer-to-peer electronic cash system. These problems are:</p>

- The **double spending** problem.
- The **centralization** problem.

<p>The <b>double spending</b> problem is about being able to have an electronic cash system that stops User A from spending the same coin to User B and User C at the same time. Normal currencies don't have this problem, because physical bills cannot be used twice, and digital fiat money is controlled by the state.</p>

<p>To address the double spending problem, one of the solutions is to have a trusted third party. But this also comes with its own risk. The third trusted party can be hacked or attacked, and it can have bad intentions and steal the money from the currency owners; therefore this involves the second problem, the centralization problem.</p>

<p>For the <b>centralization</b> problem, bitcion solves it thanks to being a peer-to-peer network that doesn't require trust. Because it's the same players who has to both 1) mine the new blocks and 2) verify that the bitcoin protocol is been followed and no one is taking advantage of the system.</p>


<h4>Implementations of bitcoin (blockchain...)</h4>
<p>Some of the key implementations of this technology are:</p>

- **Blockchain**: It consists on blocks in which every new block contains the hash of the previous block, thus, forming a chain of blocks. It serves as a timestamp server, since we can't trust any person or company to give the time to bitcoin, bitcoin creates its own time with the blockchain.
- **Miners**: A miner is a computer that is making calculations very fast to solve a calculation. Like a puzzle solver. Every time a block is mined in the blockchain, the miner that solved the calculation obtains a reward. At the same time the block is linked into the blockchain, and all of the transactions inside of the block get confirmed.
- **Nodes**: In addition to miners, nodes are those that hold the whole blockchain. To guarantee that bitcoin remains decentralized and working, it is needed that everyone can open their own node. Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.
- **Encryption**: To solve each block, it is needed that the miners find a number that when applied a SHA256 encryption algorythm, it returns a number, that has a number of zeroes smaller to the current Bitcoin difficulty. As there is no shortcut for the answer, the miner needs to find the answer by brute force, trying all possible combinations as fast as possible, to be the first to find the block and be able to claim the rewards.

<h4>Incentives</h4>
<p>Incentives are very well aligned in bitcoin, I can't name everything in such a short space, but to name a few:</p>

- **Bitcoin is scarce:** This serves two purposes: 1) bitcoin is deflationary, which means that you are more or less guaranted that in the long run your savings in bitcoin will still be worth the same or more, 2) it helps the network to gain traction so people are incentived to enter as soon as possible, since a perfect network with no users is worth as much as a pinch of salt.
- **Diminishing bitcoin reward:** Every 2140 blocks (≈4 years) the bitcoin reward gets halved. This puts a big incentive on people to get on bitcoin as fast as possible, since the aquisition will get scarcer every halving period.
- **Bitcoin's supply is pre-estrablished:** Everyone knows from beforehand the total amount of bitcoin that will ever exist (21 million), as well as the supply rate in which these bitcoins will be mined. For the first halving, every block grants the miner 50 bitcoins, for the second halving, every block grants the miner 25 bitcoins, and so on. Around the year 2140, the reward will be reduced to 0. <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.blockpit.io/blog/bitcoin-halving">[5]</a>
- **Miner's rewards:** Nowadays, miners depend mainly of the reward that the network grants them, at year 2025 which corresponds to the 4 halving, it is 3.25BTC per blocks. As rewards get lower the miners will depend more on the fees for the users that want to add transactions to the blockchain, and when the bitcoin reward is 0, they will depend solely on the fees.
- **Why have a node:** Nodes don't grant rewards like miners; however, to be sure that all your bitcoins are safe, it's important to protect the network. There are currently around 30000 public nodes, but as long as one node is working the network can work. Bitcoin network only depends on math, internet, and the existance of people with good will. So the incentive here is that those that have a big capital in bitcoin may buy a node, to protect the network and thus their wealth.
- **Why only 21 million bitcoins?** So, the whole point of bitcoin, is that it is limited to protect the wealth that you have invested there to buy bitcoin. **Could bitcoin code be changed to increase the amount to more than 21 million?** The answer is that technically yes, bitcoin receives updates constantly, they are called BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bitcoin/bips">[6]</a>, but realistically, it is not going to happen. BIPs get accepted or rejected based on the community consensus. Increasing the amount to more than 21 million would dilute the wealth of Bitcoin owners. So, regarding incentives, those that are the most involved in the network are the least interested to increase the amount of total bitcoins.

<h4>Common doubts <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.marcialpons.es/media/pdf/55178_La_filosofia_de_BITCOIN.pdf">[7]</a></h4>

**But Bitcoin is Volatile:**
<p>That Bitcoin is volatile is one of the most common criticisms. And it is true. But the price is extrinsic to it. It just means that the market still doesn't know which value it has, and it's still discovering its price. As time goes on, its volatility decreases. However, the volatility is good, since bitcoin is not a company nor does it have a marketing department to promote it. Hadn't it been for the volatility, Bitcoin would still be worth 1$.</p>
<p>There was a famous term called <b>HODL</b> which comes from a post of a drunk person in 2013, who said that he was a terrible trader, and could not anticipate the lows and highs of bitcoin to make money, but he realized that if he forgot the short-term and just holded the asset, then the traders will not be able to make profit out of him.</p>
<p>There is a lot to learn about Bitcoin; therefore, there is a big asymetry of knowledge, and this is what causes people to enter FOMO mode when it goes up, and run away when it goes down, in fear, because they don't understand the asset. Based on this, we should focus on understanding the asset and looking on the long term, and not let our emotions on the short term dictate when to buy or sell.</p>

**Why Bitcoin and not Crypto:**
<p>There is a big flaw in including everything in the term 'crypto', by which it looks that all the other crypto assets compete with Bitcoin. Other technologies do not compete against Bitcoin, because they don't even <i>intend</i> to do it. As we have seen one of the most important qualities of bitcoin is to not depend on third parties. If you have a network that has been running on its own for more than ten years, why would you want a cheap alternative, that could be manipulated by any person or company at any given moment.</p>
<p>The other projects do not aim to be global monetary systems, rather, they aim to be entrepreneurial projects, or even worse, <i>neolottery</i>. Remember that if you think that a bitcoin is too expensive, you can always buy sats.</p>
