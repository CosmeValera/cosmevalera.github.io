Understanding Bitcoin is essential, and it is something you should continue exploring on your own. Investing in an asset you do not truly believe in often leads to losses, especially with Bitcoin, which can move 10% in either direction at any moment because of its volatility. These short-term price changes do not affect its core fundamentals or intrinsic value.

This post is not about Bitcoin’s fundamentals, since that topic is covered in the first article of this series: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin/"><b>BTC 101: Why Bitcoin?</b></a> Instead, the purpose here is to give you just enough information to start buying your first sats directly from your phone.

<h4>Setting up a Bitcoin Exchange</h4>

<p>An exchange is an app that lets you buy or sell Bitcoin (or sats, the smallest unit of Bitcoin) at current market price. While popular platforms like Binance or Coinbase exist, they are general crypto exchanges that offer a wide range of tokens we are not interested in. Since our goal is only to buy Bitcoin, we will use a Bitcoin-only exchange. These apps reduce distractions from other assets and often provide useful features for regularly buying sats.</p>

<p>On your phone, install either <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fior.digital21app">21Bitcoin</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.relai">Relai</a>. Both work in a very similar way and are designed for buying Bitcoin. In this guide, I will use 21Bitcoin for the examples and screenshots.</p>

> There are other ways to buy Bitcoin, such as using peer-to-peer exchanges like <a target="_blank" href="https://hodlhodl.com/">HodlHodl</a> without KYC (Know Your Customer). However, that's too advanced for your first purchase, and a little bit of KYC is fine to start.

<b>A Long-Term Mindset</b>

<p>It is important to understand that Bitcoin is not a “get rich quick” scheme or a one-time lottery ticket. You do not simply buy once, wait, and then sell when the price goes up. Instead, Bitcoin should be seen as a long-term savings technology. The approach that has been proven most effective is to buy small amounts regularly, using a strategy called dollar-cost averaging (DCA), and allow time and patience to grow your holdings.</p>

<p>At the end of this post, we will briefly compare DCA with other strategies such as lump-sum investing and timing the market, and highlight the benefits and tradeoffs of each.</p>  

<b>Configure the exchange</b>

<p>After installing the exchange, complete the KYC (ID and personal info). The approval may take some time. Once verified, the app will ask for a small first purchase of sats (around €5), just follow the steps.</p>

<p>Once everything is set up, we can now buy sats! These sats will be held in the wallet of the exchange's app, from which we can buy or sell whenever we want at the current market price of that moment.</p>

<p>However, even though usually nothing should happen, at the end of the day, keeping our sats in the exchange's wallet, carries the risk of the exchange potentially being able to steal our funds. For that reason, and because Bitcoin whole philosophy is based on not relying on third parties. We will configure <b> automatic transfer of the purchased bitcoins to our own BTC wallet</b> so that the sats that we buy are not kept in a wallet susceptible of theft from the exchange.</p>

<p>In addition to that, because it's preferable to buy Bitcoin with a long-term mindset. We will also configure <b> a savings plan for periodic purchases.</b> Let's see this first and after we will see how to create a BTC wallet and configure the exchange to be able to send the trasfer to our wallet.</p>

<b>Periodic purchases</b>
<p>Go to: <b>Bitcoin -> Savings -> Show Deposit Details</b></p>

<p>Now you can use that information to create periodic purchases of bitcoin from your bank account to 21Bitcoin. The amount and the periodicity of these purchases is completely up to you. For example, you can start making automatic purchases of 100€ per month. It's normal to start with little, and once you see how it goes, you can adapt the plan.</p>
<p>About the specific information, you can see that for the deposit there is no fee. But for the purchase fee they take 0.79% which is less than 1% so it's very nice (we are here to stay on the long-term, not to buy once and sell tomorroow, if we do that, just from the exchange's fees we will end up losig money). Also notice that minimum amount for this savings plan is 10€ so if you send 5€ with this pplan they will just send the 5€ back.</p>
<p>Take also into account the fee, and if for example you want to buy 30€ every week, just out of fees, 30€x4= 120€, from which you will effectively actually invest 116€ because of the fees. So in this case, it could be more worth it, to just make a month purchase of 120€, to have an effective investment of 119€. However, if you are going to invest more than for example 100€ per week, then the fee starts to represent a very small percentage of the total purchase, and it becomes less necessary to put together the purchases into a monthly purchase. Anyway, at the end of the day as I said, how much you want to invest and how often is completely up to you, I'm just trying to warn you to be careful because really small purchases are not so worth it, since they are taken out a big percentage of the total investment just by the exchange's fee.</p>

<p>We've covered how to buy our first sats. Let's see how we can create our first BTC wallet.</p>

<h4>Save your sats in your own wallet</h4>

<p>.</p>

<h4>Secure your seed phrase</h4>

---


```js
Option 1: Exchange → Wallet → Security (most natural flow)
1. Set up an exchange (Relai/21Bitcoin)
  - Makes sense to start here, since people need a place to actually buy sats.
2. Set up a hot wallet (BlueWallet)
  - Once they’ve bought sats, they’ll want to move them somewhere they control.
  - Include the quick hot vs cold wallet explanation here.
3. Secure your seed phrase (Bitwarden, etc.)
  - After they generate the wallet, you explain how to safely store the seed.
```

```js
- BTC 102: Getting Started - Your First Bitcoin Purchase
  - Summary: Simple set up of using Relai/21Bitcoin to buy your bitcoins with DCA every month (DCA vs lump-sum vs timing the market (be brief, and why DCA is recommended in my opinion))
- BTC 102: Getting Started - Your First Bitcoin Purchase
  - Setting up exchanges (Relai/21Bitcoin)
  - Setting up a hot wallet (Blue Wallet, etc.)
    - A quick note saying that the difference between hot vs cold wallet is that cold wallets never ever interact with internet.
  - Basic security practices (Bitwarden)
  - DCA vs lump sum vs timing the market
  - Very brief mention to what is the mempool, and use it check transaction confirmation

* Quick notes. 1: The idea of 102 is to be as brief as possible, so people can actually start somewhere buying their first sats with just enough information.
```
