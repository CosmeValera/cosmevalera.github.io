<p>Understanding Bitcoin is essential, and it is something you should continue exploring on your own. Investing in an asset you do not truly believe in often leads to losses, especially with Bitcoin, which can move 10% in either direction at any moment due to its volatility. These short-term price changes do not affect its core fundamentals or intrinsic value.</p>

<p>This post is not about Bitcoin's fundamentals, since that topic is covered in the first article of this series: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin/"><b>BTC 101: Why Bitcoin?</b></a> Instead, the purpose here is to give you just enough information to start buying your first sats directly from your phone.</p>

---

<h4>Setting up a Bitcoin Exchange</h4>

<p>An exchange is a platform that lets you buy or sell bitcoins (or sats, the smallest unit of bitcoin) at current market prices. Popular platforms like Binance and Coinbase are general cryptocurrency exchanges offering numerous tokens that don't align with our focus. Since we're specifically interested in Bitcoin, <b>we'll use a Bitcoin-only exchange</b> instead. These apps reduce distractions from other assets and often provide useful features for regularly buying sats.</p>

<p>On your phone, install either <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fior.digital21app">21Bitcoin</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.relai">Relai</a>. Both work in a very similar way and are designed for buying Bitcoin. In this guide, I will use <b>21Bitcoin</b> for the examples and screenshots.</p>

> There are other ways to buy Bitcoin, such as using peer-to-peer exchanges like <a target="_blank" href="https://hodlhodl.com/">HodlHodl</a> without **KYC (Know Your Customer)**. However, these methods are more complex for beginners, and a little bit of KYC is fine to start with.

<b>A Long-Term Mindset</b>

<p>Bitcoin is not a "get rich quick" scheme or a lottery ticket where you buy once and cash out when its price rises. <b>Think of Bitcoin as a long-term savings technology</b> instead. The most proven approach is to consistently purchase small amounts over time through a strategy called <b>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</b>, and allow time and patience to grow your holdings.</p>

<p>Later in this post, we will briefly compare DCA with other strategies such as lump-sum investing and timing the market, along with the pros and cons of each strategy.</p>  

<b>Configure the Exchange</b>

<p>After installing the exchange, complete the KYC (ID and personal info). The approval may take some time. Once verified, the app might ask for a small first purchase of sats (around 5‚Ç¨), just follow the steps.</p>

<p>Once everything is set up, <b>you can start buying sats!</b> These sats will be held in the exchange's wallet, from which you can buy or sell whenever you want at the current market price.</p>

<p>To implement our DCA strategy effectively, we need to configure two key features:</p>

1. **A savings plan** for automated periodic purchases
2. **Automatic transfers** to your own Bitcoin wallet for self-custody

<p>The savings plan ensures we buy regularly without manual effort. The automatic transfers are important because, although exchanges like 21Bitcoin are generally trustworthy, Bitcoin's philosophy is about self-custody and full control over our funds. Let's start with the periodic purchases, then move on to wallet setup and transfers.</p>

<b>Periodic Purchases</b>
<p>In 21Bitcoin go to: <b>Bitcoin -> Savings -> Show Deposit Details.</b></p>

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/pp-1.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/pp-2.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/pp-3.jpg"></img>

<p>Use this information to set up automatic Bitcoin purchases from your bank account to 21Bitcoin. Start with an amount you're comfortable with, perhaps 100‚Ç¨ per month, and adjust as you gain experience.</p>

<p>Key details to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No deposit fee</b> for bank transfers</li>
<li><b>0.79% purchase fee</b>, quite reasonable for long-term investing</li>
<li><b>10‚Ç¨ minimum</b> for savings plans (smaller amounts will be returned)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fee optimization tip:</b> Consider the frequency of your purchases relative to fees. Four weekly 30‚Ç¨ purchases cost more in fees (1.96‚Ç¨ total) than one monthly 120‚Ç¨ purchase (0.95‚Ç¨). However, as your purchase amounts increase, this difference becomes negligible, and you can prioritize the DCA benefits of more frequent purchases.</p>

<p>We've covered how to buy your first sats. Now let's see how you can <b>set up your first BTC wallet.</b></p>

<h4>Setting up your BTC Wallet</h4>

<p>On your phone, install <a target="_blank" href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a>. This is a user-friendly and well-regarded open-source Bitcoin wallet that will allow you to store your sats securely instead of relying on the exchange. While BlueWallet is a hot wallet (which has its own risks), it's safer than leaving your Bitcoin on an exchange where you depend on a third party.</p>

> **Hot vs Cold Wallets:** Both hot and cold wallets allow their owners to send or receive sats. The difference is that a hot wallet like BlueWallet generates your private seed using an internet-connected device, making it convenient but potentially vulnerable during seed creation. A cold wallet (like Coldcard or BitBox) generates your seed completely offline, providing maximum security. For beginners, a reputable hot wallet offers a good balance of security and usability.

<p>After installing BlueWallet, let's create our first wallet:</p> 

- Click <b>Add now</b> in the Add a wallet box
- Give it a name like <i>MyBlueWallet</i>, select type <i>Bitcoin</i>, click <b>Create</b>
- The app will generate a seed phrase (12 words) that serves as the master key to your bitcoins

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-1.jpg"></img>

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-3.jpg"></img>

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Warning:** Your seed phrase is like your bank account password, it gives complete control over your sats. Anyone who has access to it can steal all your funds. Never share it with anyone and never store it digitally (notes apps, screenshots, emails) since malware could access these files. You can write it on paper, but using a password manager is a better option for the long-term (paper can be lost, damaged, or destroyed).

<p>That's your seed phrase, it's your master key and only backup for recovering your wallet if you lose access to your phone. In the next section, we'll see how to store it safely using Bitwarden. Later we will see how to set up automatic transfers and how to make transactions with BlueWallet.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Password Manager</h4>

<p>If you already have a password manager, you can use it. Otherwise, I'll show you how to use <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden">Bitwarden</a> to store your seed phrase.</p>

<p>On your phone, install Bitwarden and create an account. Choose a strong master password you can remember, as this will be the key to accessing all your stored information.</p>

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Warning:** Bitwarden is end-to-end encrypted, so they can't see your data or reset your password. If you forget your master password, you'll lose access to everything permanently. Set a password hint and write the password on paper if needed.

<p>Once we have an account in Bitwarden, let's save the private seed:</p>

- Click the <b>plus icon (+)</b> at the bottom right
- Type <b>Secure Note</b>
- Give it a name like <i>Blue Wallet</i>, click on <b>Additional options</b>
- Click on <b>Add field</b>, type <b>Hidden</b>, name <b>Seed Phrase</b>
- <b>Fill the Seed Phrase field with the 12 words in BLueWallet</b>
- Click <b>Save</b> at the top right

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-2.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-3.jpg"></img>

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-4.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-6.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-8.jpg"></img>

<!-- <img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/bitw-7.jpg"></img> -->

<p>Now you should be able to access your note called <i>Blue Wallet</i> in Bitwarden, and see your seed phrase inside of it.</p>

> üí° **Tip:** If you can't find your 12 words or made a mistake saving them, just create a new wallet. It's free and takes seconds.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Double-check your seed phrase in Bitwarden for typos. Even one wrong letter means you won't be able to recover your funds if you lose your phone.

Let's see now how to configure automatic transfers from 21Bitcoin to our BlueWallet.

---

<h4>Automatic transfers</h4>

<p>To configure automatic transfers first we need to go back to BlueWallet to obtain our Bitcoin address so we can receive sats. Go to: <b>BlueWallet -> Click in MyBlueWallet card -> Click Receive</b>. In the receive screen you should see a QR and a Bitcoin address. The btc address looks something like "bc1q...". Click it to copy.</p>

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-7.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-4.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-5.jpg"></img>

<p>To configure automatic transfers we have two options:</p>

- Set <b>Non-Custodial Mode</b>, so that every purchase will be sent to your external wallet
- Set a <b>BTC Balance limit</b> so every time the limit is reached your funds will be send to your external wallet.

<p>For either option, in 21Bitcoin go to: <b>Bitcoin</b> -> <b>Auto Transfer</b> -> <b>Select non-custodial mode (or set a limit)</b> -> <b>Click Add Wallet</b> -> <b>In the Add Wallet section: 1) select Private Wallet, 2) Add as name 'MyBlueWallet', and in address paste the address you copied from BlueWallet</b> -> <b>Verify ownership by clicking on 2FA signature</b> -> <b>Confirm that the wallet is correct (check that the last letters of the wallet correspond to the one you copied in BlueWallet)</b> -> <b>Select the Wallet you have just created</b>.</p> 

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/automatictransfers/1.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/automatictransfers/2.jpg"></img>
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/automatictransfers/3.jpg"></img>


<p>Here also about the fee optimization, all transfers cost 1000sats, so taking that that's an euro. This makes even more important the fee optimization. Since 4 purchases of 30‚Ç¨ (would have approximately a fee of 5.96‚Ç¨ total) vs one monthly purchase of 120‚Ç¨ (1.95‚Ç¨). This is of course related to the non-custodial mode vs limit. The non-custodial mode you have to pay 1000 sats every single time you make a transfer, while with the  limit, you could set a limit of 300 or 500 euros, and this way this 1000 extra sats will be even less painful and you are still granted that always after X time all your purchased sats will be redirected automatically to your private wallet</p>

<h4>Mempool</h4>

<!-- Say here that you can send and receive bitcoin transfers with bluewallet, and you will be able to see the current state of your transaction in the mempool -->
<p>.</p>
<!-- Here images with 1) like wallet-4 but with a transaction incoming, 5) openinng the transaction and 6) seeing it in the mempool -->
<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-4.jpg"></img>

<!-- Mention also wallet-6 maybe, saying that you can also send any amoung of sats with the app, and you only need the other person's address, which you can paste here or use the scan to scan their qr, and set the fee. For the free price, it's useful visiting the mempool too, to see what is the fee price that you should put depending on if you are in a hurry -->
