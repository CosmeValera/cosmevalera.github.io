<p>Understanding Bitcoin is essential, and it is something you should continue exploring on your own. Investing in an asset you do not truly believe in often leads to losses, especially with Bitcoin, which can move 10% in either direction at any moment due to its volatility. These short-term price changes do not affect its core fundamentals or intrinsic value.</p>

<p>This post is not about Bitcoin's fundamentals, since that topic is covered in the first article of this series: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin/"><b>BTC 101: Why Bitcoin?</b></a> Instead, the purpose here is to give you just enough information to start buying your first sats directly from your phone.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Bitcoin Exchange</h4>

<p>An exchange is a platform that lets you buy or sell bitcoins (or sats, the smallest unit of bitcoin) at current market prices. Popular platforms like Binance and Coinbase are general cryptocurrency exchanges offering numerous tokens that don't align with our focus. Since we're specifically interested in Bitcoin, <b>we'll use a Bitcoin-only exchange</b> instead. These apps reduce distractions from other assets and often provide useful features for regularly buying sats.</p>

<p>On your phone, install either <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fior.digital21app">21Bitcoin</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.relai">Relai</a>. Both work in a very similar way and are designed for buying Bitcoin. In this guide, I will use <b>21Bitcoin</b> for the examples and screenshots.</p>

> There are other ways to buy Bitcoin, such as using peer-to-peer exchanges like <a target="_blank" href="https://hodlhodl.com/">HodlHodl</a> without **KYC (Know Your Customer)**. However, these methods are more complex for beginners, and a little bit of KYC is fine to start with.

<b>A Long-Term Mindset</b>

<p>Bitcoin is not a "get rich quick" scheme or a lottery ticket where you buy once and cash out when its price rises. <b>Think of Bitcoin as a long-term savings technology</b> instead. The most proven approach is to consistently purchase small amounts over time through a strategy called <b>dollar-cost averaging (DCA)</b>, and allow time and patience to grow your holdings.</p>

<p>Later in this post, we will briefly compare DCA with other strategies such as lump-sum investing and timing the market, along with the pros and cons of each strategy.</p>  

<b>Configure the Exchange</b>

<p>After installing the exchange, complete the KYC (ID and personal info). The approval may take some time. Once verified, the app might ask for a small first purchase of sats (around 5€), just follow the steps.</p>

<p>Once everything is set up, <b>you can start buying sats!</b> These sats will be held in the exchange's wallet, from which you can buy or sell whenever you want at the current market price.</p>

<p>To implement our DCA strategy effectively, we need to configure two key features:</p>

1. **A savings plan** for automated periodic purchases
2. **Automatic transfers** to your own Bitcoin wallet for self-custody

<p>The savings plan ensures we buy regularly without manual effort. The automatic transfers are important because, although exchanges like 21Bitcoin are generally trustworthy, Bitcoin's philosophy is about self-custody and full control over our funds. Let's start with the periodic purchases, then move on to wallet setup and transfers.</p>

<b>Periodic Purchases</b>
<p>In 21Bitcoin go to: <b>Bitcoin -> Savings -> Show Deposit Details.</b></p>

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/pp-3.jpg"></img>

<p>Use this information to set up automatic Bitcoin purchases from your bank account to 21Bitcoin. Start with an amount you're comfortable with, perhaps 100€ per month, and adjust as you gain experience.</p>

<p>Key details to note:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>No deposit fee</b> for bank transfers</li>
<li><b>0.79% purchase fee</b>, quite reasonable for long-term investing</li>
<li><b>10€ minimum</b> for savings plans (smaller amounts will be returned)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Fee optimization tip:</b> Consider the frequency of your purchases relative to fees. Four weekly 30€ purchases cost more in fees (1.96€ total) than one monthly 120€ purchase (0.95€). However, as your purchase amounts increase, this difference becomes negligible, and you can prioritize the DCA benefits of more frequent purchases.</p>

<p>We've covered how to buy your first sats. Now let's see how you can <b>set up your first BTC wallet.</b></p>

<h4>Setting up your BTC Wallet</h4>

<p>On your phone, install <a target="_blank" href="https://bluewallet.io/">BlueWallet</a>. This is a user-friendly and well-regarded open-source Bitcoin wallet that will allow you to store your sats securely instead of relying on the exchange. While BlueWallet is a hot wallet (which has its own risks), it's safer than leaving your Bitcoin on an exchange where you depend on a third party.</p>

> **Hot vs Cold Wallets:** Both hot and cold wallets allow their owners to send or receive sats. The difference is that a hot wallet like BlueWallet generates your private seed using an internet-connected device, making it convenient but potentially vulnerable during seed creation. A cold wallet (like Coldcard or BitBox) generates your seed completely offline, providing maximum security. For beginners, a reputable hot wallet offers a good balance of security and usability.

<p>After installing BlueWallet, let's create our first wallet:</p> 

- Click <b>Add now</b> in the Add a wallet box
- Give it a name like <i>MyBlueWallet</i>, select type <i>Bitcoin</i>, click <b>Create</b>
- The app will generate a seed phrase (12 words) that serves as the master key to your bitcoins

<img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2025-10-14-bitcoin-2/wallet-3.jpg"></img>

> **⚠️ Critical Security Warning:** Your seed phrase is like your bank account password, it gives complete control over your sats. Anyone who has access to it can steal all your funds. Never share it with anyone and never store it digitally (notes apps, screenshots, emails) since malware could access these files. You can write it on paper, but using a password manager is a better option for the long-term (paper can be lost, damaged, or destroyed).

<p>That's your seed phrase, it's your master key and only backup for recovering your wallet if you lose access to your phone. In the next section, we'll see how to store it safely using Bitwarden. Later we will see how to make transactions with BlueWallet.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Password Manager</h4>

<p>If you already have a password manager, you can use it. Otherwise, I'll show you how to use <a target="_blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.x8bit.bitwarden">Bitwarden</a> to store your seed phrase.</p>

<p>On your phone, install Bitwarden and create an account. Choose a strong master password you can remember, as this will be the key to accessing all your stored information.</p>

> **⚠️ Critical Security Warning:** Bitwarden is end-to-end encrypted, so they can't see your data or reset your password. If you forget your master password, you'll lose access to everything permanently. Set a password hint and write the password on paper if needed.

<!-- BITWARDEN Configuration and images -->

<p>.</p>

<!-- <p>Once your wallet is set up, you'll have a Bitcoin address that looks something like "bc1q..." This address is where you'll receive your Bitcoin transfers from the exchange. Copy this address and return to your 21Bitcoin app to configure automatic withdrawals to your BlueWallet address.</p> -->

<h4>Configure automatic transfer of the purchased bitcoins</h4>
<p>.</p>

<!-- Here talk, now that we have the 3 apps, about how to do that last bit of automatizing the purchases -->

<!-- Here also about the fee optimization, all transfers cost 1000sats, so taking that that's an euro. This makes even more important the fee optimization. Since 4 purchases of 30€ (would have approximately a fee of 5.96€ total) vs one monthly purchase of 120€ (1.95€) -->

<h4>Strategies for buying bitcoin (DCA vs lumpsum vs market timing like buy the dip)</h4>

```js
Option 1: Exchange → Wallet → Security (most natural flow)
1. Set up an exchange (Relai/21Bitcoin)
  - Makes sense to start here, since people need a place to actually buy sats.
2. Set up a hot wallet (BlueWallet)
  - Once they’ve bought sats, they’ll want to move them somewhere they control.
  - Include the quick hot vs cold wallet explanation here.
3. Secure your seed phrase (Bitwarden, etc.)
  - After they generate the wallet, you explain how to safely store the seed.
```

```js
- BTC 102: Getting Started - Your First Bitcoin Purchase
  - Summary: Simple set up of using Relai/21Bitcoin to buy your bitcoins with DCA every month (DCA vs lump-sum vs timing the market (be brief, and why DCA is recommended in my opinion))
- BTC 102: Getting Started - Your First Bitcoin Purchase
  - Setting up exchanges (Relai/21Bitcoin)
  - Setting up a hot wallet (Blue Wallet, etc.)
    - A quick note saying that the difference between hot vs cold wallet is that cold wallets never ever interact with internet.
  - Basic security practices (Bitwarden)
  - DCA vs lump sum vs timing the market
  - Very brief mention to what is the mempool, and use it check transaction confirmation

* Quick notes. 1: The idea of 102 is to be as brief as possible, so people can actually start somewhere buying their first sats with just enough information.
