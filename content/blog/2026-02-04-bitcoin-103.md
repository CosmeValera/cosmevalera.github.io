<b>Why should I care about Cold Storage?</b>

<p>People have lost hundreds of millions in Bitcoin. These are the most common reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Lost seed phrase:</b> <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zel3ng1vo">James Howells</a> accidentally threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin (now worth over 700 million euros) in 2013.</li>
    <li><b>Scams or phishing attacks:</b> <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://heraldsheets.com/protocol-podcast-host-loses-bitcoin-btc-savings/">Eric Savics</a> lost 7 years of savings (over 1 million euros in Bitcoin) in 20 minutes after downloading a fake wallet app.</li>
    <li><b>Exchange hacks/collapse:</b> The <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-went-wrong-with-ftx-6828447">FTX collapse</a> in 2022 left customers unable to access billions in Bitcoin they stored on the exchange.</li>
    <li><b>Death without an inheritance plan:</b> Family members unable to <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/education/multi-sig-custody-and-inheritance/">access Bitcoin after the owner's death</a>, lost forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern: Most losses are from not having proper backups or giving up custody to third parties. This is why cold storage is essential, especially when you have a significant amount of Bitcoin.</p>

<b>What is Cold Storage?</b>

<p>Cold storage is the practice of securing Bitcoin offline, away from internet-connected devices and potential hackers. It's the standard for protecting significant amounts of Bitcoin you plan to hold long-term.</p>

<p>As we saw in <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-102/"><b>BTC 102: How to Buy Bitcoin Securely</b></a>, a hot wallet is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated online, it's convenient, but also potentially vulnerable. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated offline, and where the seed phrase has never been exposed to any online device, thus it is immune to online hacks. However, this security comes with responsibility: your Bitcoin is only safe as long as you don't share the private seed and don't lose it.</p> 

<b>When should I move to Cold Storage?</b>

<p>There is no hard rule for when to move to cold storage, but it's usually said that you should consider it when you have around 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hardware wallets cost around 100-250 euros, plus the cost of a backup system for your seed phrase (around 50-100 euros). If you only have 100 euros in Bitcoin, the investment may not be justified yet. However, some people prefer the peace of mind of going cold storage from the beginning, it's a matter of personal preference. A good rule of thumb: if you're losing sleep worrying about your Bitcoin security, it's time to move to cold storage.</p>

<!-- The following disclaimer needs an emoji: -->
> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** I'm not being sponsored by any company. To have cold storage you will need to buy both a hardware wallet and a backup system for your seed phrase. Therefore, my recommendations are only based on my personal experience and what I think is the best option for you.

<p>In this tutorial, I'll guide you through choosing a hardware wallet and seed backup system, creating your first cold wallet with the hardware wallet, and using Sparrow to send and receive Bitcoin.</p>

<h4>Hardware Wallet</h4>

<p>A hardware wallet is a physical device that generates and stores your wallet seed offline, creating what's known as a cold wallet. This way it grants maximum security to our Bitcoin. </p>

<p>The device allows you to sign transactions offline before broadcasting them to the network, ensuring your private keys never leave the secure environment of the hardware wallet, even when sending Bitcoin. Modern hardware wallets also offer additional security features, which won't be covered in this tutorial but are worth learning about on your own, such as: temporary seeds, passphrases, multi-signature support, etc.</p>

<p>There are different options for your hardware wallet (ColdCard, BitBox02, Trezor, Jade), each one of them has a different price and sometimes different specifications. I recommend using ColdCard, either the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/mk4"><b>ColdCard Mk4</b></a> (around 150 euros) which is the device I'll use for this tutorial, or pay a little bit more to have a bigger screen and more buttons: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/q"><b>ColdCard Q</b></a> (around 250 euros). Both options are great.</p>

<p>Let's go through the process of setting up our hardware wallet, we will also see how to backup our seed phrase with metal plates and how to use Sparrow to manage our cold wallet.</p>

---

<h4>Seed phrase backup</h4>

<p>Using metal plates is the most secure way to backup your seed phrase. Metal plates are impossible to hack and they last over time. Writing down your seed phrase in a piece of paper is not secure in the long term, as it can be stolen, lost or or damaged by water or fire.</p>

<p>To backup your seed phrase with metal plates, I recommend buying: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/"><b>OneKey KeyTag</b></a> (around 60 euros). This product consists of 2 metal plates and a punch pen to record your seed phrase (you can store up to two different seed phrases). </p>

        </div>
        <p>You can also use engraving methods instead of punching, such as <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://ironhodl.com/"><b>IRON HODL</b></a> or <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://oz-usa.com/ti1000-lite-titanium-crypto-seed-phrase-recovery-cold-storage-system-metal-plate-engraving-pen/"><b>TI1000</b></a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>I recommend <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/"><b>OneKey KeyTag</b></a> because it's one of the most affordable options, includes 2 plates and a punch pen, and is both durable and easy to use.</p>
        <p>Any of these options work, the most important thing is to have a durable backup of your seed phrase. Feel free to compare prices and specifications.</p>

<h4>MicroSD card and Adapter</h4>

<p>If you use a ColdCard, you need to buy a microSD card to store the wallet export from the ColdCard, and an adapter to connect the microSD card to your computer. You can find these on Amazon or any electronics retailer. Here are examples: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08TJTB8XS?ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_ss_BEKAHX6Q2PQT6W7YVK76"><b>MicroSD</b></a> and <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09NHKN74L?ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apan_dp_ss_M728Z6W1VP4NPY6KB576"><b>Adapter</b></a>.</p>

<div class="phone-images-row">

  </a>
</div>

<p>For the following sections, we assume you have purchased the hardware wallet, the metal plate backup, and (if using ColdCard) the microSD card and adapter. If you're using a different hardware wallet, the process will be similar but the exact steps may vary.</p>

- **Click Test Connection**
- If it says "Connected to Electrum": **Click Create New Wallet**
  - If it failed, pick another Public Server URL and try again
- **Now Sparrow Wallet is set up!** 

<p>We'll import your cold wallet from the hardware wallet in the next steps. For now, Sparrow is ready and waiting.</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Video guide for Sparrow setup (first 4 minutes)</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>This video covers the Sparrow setup process (00:46-03:44). The rest of the video demonstrates hot wallet features and an alternative cold storage setup method, which you can explore if interested, but we'll be using the air-gapped method with ColdCard in the following sections.</p>

<h4>Hardware Wallet setup</h4>

<p>Now it's time to create your first cold wallet using the ColdCard. Follow along with the steps below, or if you prefer video instructions, watch the 7-minute tutorial:</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 7-minute video tutorial: Setting up the ColdCard Mk4</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
      <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-HbVnQphY0?si=_lG40LygWkR-ukqT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

- Unpack the ColdCard Mk4 (it comes with a serial number card and a temporary wallet backup card)
- Plug the ColdCard into a power source (preferably a wall outlet rather than your computer)
- Verify that the serial number on the device matches the one on the package card
- Follow the on-screen tutorial to set up your ColdCard PIN and store it on the backup card
- Select "New Seed Words" to generate your first cold wallet
- Write down the seed words on the backup card and complete the verification quiz
- Once complete, your ColdCard will display "Ready to Sign" as the first menu option

<p>Congratulations! Your ColdCard is now ready to sign transactions offline 🥳</p>

<p>Before we use it, there's one critical step: moving your seed phrase from the temporary backup card to the permanent metal plate.</p>

---

<h4>Backup your seed phrase in metal</h4>

<p>The backup card that came with your ColdCard is only meant for temporary storage during setup. Now we'll transfer your seed phrase to a permanent, fireproof, and waterproof metal backup.</p>

    </div>
</details>

<p><b>Creating your metal backup:</b></p>

- Unpack the OneKey KeyTag (includes two metal plates, a punch pen, and instructions)
- Use the punch pen to carefully punch the holes corresponding to each word of your seed phrase
- Double-check your work (each word must be punched correctly)
- Optional: Add an NFC chip to store a note (like "Bitcoin wallet backup")
- Optional: Apply the tamper-evident seal (wait until after you've verified the backup works)

<p><b>⚠️ Critical security steps:</b></p>

- **Never photograph** your seed words or backup card
- **Don't let anyone see** your seed phrase while you're working
- Once you've punched the metal plate, **burn or shred** the paper backup card completely

<p><b>Verify your backup before destroying the paper:</b></p>

Before destroying the backup card, it's wise to test your metal backup. You can do this by temporarily deleting your wallet from Sparrow and restoring it using only the metal plate. This ensures that if you ever need to recover your wallet years from now, you'll be able to. Don't wait 10 years to discover your backup doesn't work!

<p><b>Store your metal plate securely:</b></p>

<p>Your metal plate is now the master key to your Bitcoin. Anyone who finds it can access your funds. Consider storing it in a home safe or other secure location. Remember: the ColdCard stores the wallet in its secure element, so for day-to-day use you won't need the metal plate, it's only for recovery if your ColdCard is lost or damaged.</p>

<p>Now that your cold wallet is secured and backed up, let's learn how to use it with Sparrow to send and receive Bitcoin!</p>

---

<h4>Import your Cold Wallet to Sparrow</h4>

<p>Before we can receive Bitcoin, we need to import your cold wallet from the ColdCard into Sparrow. This process only exports your wallet's public information (xpub), not your private seed phrase, which remains safely stored in the ColdCard.</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 13-minute video tutorial: Using ColdCard Mk4 with Sparrow (air-gapped)</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>This video demonstrates the complete air-gapped workflow with ColdCard Mk4 and Sparrow: <b>importing the wallet (5:36), receiving Bitcoin (8:42), and sending Bitcoin via air-gapped signing (9:55)</b>. Perfect companion to the written instructions below.</p>
        <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BEwWInJ5Ldo?si=YOUR_SI_PARAM&start=336" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

<p>Here's how to import your wallet:</p>

- Insert the microSD card into your ColdCard
- On the ColdCard, navigate to: **Advanced → MicroSD Card → Export Wallet → Generic JSON**
- The ColdCard will save a file to the microSD card
- Remove the microSD card and insert it into your computer using the adapter
- In Sparrow, click **File → New Wallet**
- Name your wallet (e.g., "Cold Storage")
- Click **Airgapped Hardware Wallet → ColdCard → Import File**
- Choose the JSON file from your microSD card
- Click **Apply** to complete the setup

<p>Your cold wallet is now connected to Sparrow! The wallet shows your Bitcoin addresses and balance, but all signing still happens offline on the ColdCard.</p>

---

<h4>Receive Bitcoin in Sparrow</h4>

<p>Receiving Bitcoin to your cold wallet is simple. Let's transfer some Bitcoin from your hot wallet (like BlueWallet) to test that everything works.</p>

<p>Here's how:</p>

- In Sparrow, click the **Receive** tab on the left sidebar
- Sparrow will display a Bitcoin address and QR code
- Copy this address or scan the QR code with your phone
- In your hot wallet (BlueWallet), go to **Send**
- Paste the address from Sparrow and send a small amount (start with a test transaction)
- Wait for the transaction to be broadcast to the network

<p>Within a few seconds, you should see the pending transaction appear in Sparrow. Once it's confirmed in a block, the Bitcoin is secured in your cold storage! 🎉</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Why does confirmation take so long?</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>Bitcoin transactions need to be included in a block and added to the blockchain. You can check the status of your transaction on <a href="https://mempool.space/" target="_blank">mempool.space</a></p>
    </div>
</details>
