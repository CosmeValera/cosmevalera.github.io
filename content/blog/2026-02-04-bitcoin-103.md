<p>In this post I'm going to explain you how you can bring maximum security to your purchased Bitcoin. It's important that you have already read <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-101/"><b>BTC 101: Why Bitcoin?</b></a> and <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-102/"><b>BTC 102: How to Buy Bitcoin Securely</b></a>. It's better that you start small and calm buying sats periodically and storing them in your hot wallet, and only moving on to cold storage once you have an amount that is substantial for you.</p>

<p><b>What do I mean with a substantial or important amount, or when should you start with Cold Storage?</b> The amount can be anything, but usually it is said that around 2 salaries, or an amount that doesn't let you sleep at ease. Before that, you should not even consider buying a Hardware Wallet. Take into consideration that what we have to buy here will cost around 200€, so if you have for example 80€ invested in Bitcoin, maybe it's a bit too soon to think about saving it in Cold Storage</p>

<h4>Setting up a Hardware Wallet</h4>

<p>The key is that your private keys never touch the internet, making them immune to online hacks. A hardware wallet or a Cold wallet is a device that will generate our wallet seed offline, this way it will grant maximum security to our Bitcoin.</p>

<p>There are different options for your Hardware Wallet (ColdCard, BitBox02, Trezor, Jade. Avoid Ledger), each one of them has a different price, and sometimes different specifications. The best idea is to find something that is airgapped, so we can create out seed completely offline. In this case I will explain how to set up the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/mk4"><b>ColdCard Mk4</b></a>.</p>

```js
  - When to make the move from hot to cold storage
    - Important to mention at the start that it's important to start small based on what is said in BTC 102, and wait several months before going Cold Storage.
    - Regarding when someone should start in cold storage: it's usually said that when you have 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin in a hot wallet. Another option to know when to take the step is when you can't sleep at ease.
  - Hot vs cold wallet differences (it's been already covered in 102, maybe mention again, to make it even more clear that cold wallets bring a 100% safety as long as you do everything correctly: don't share the private seed and don't lose it)
  - Setting up hardware wallets (Coldcard MK4/Q)
  - Seed phrase backup with metal plates (OneKey KeyTag)
  - Basic Sparrow wallet setup (Link to another Sparrow post maybe BTC-204 )
