<b>What is Cold Storage?</b>

<p>Cold storage is the practice of securing Bitcoin offline, away from internet-connected devices and potential hackers. It's the standard for protecting significant amounts of Bitcoin you plan to hold long-term.</p>

<p>As we saw in <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-102/"><b>BTC 102: How to Buy Bitcoin Securely</b></a>, a hot wallet is a wallet that has generated its seed phrase online, it's convenient, but also potentially vulnerable. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is a wallet that has generated its seed phrase offline, thus it is immune to online hacks. However, this security comes with responsibility: your Bitcoin is only safe as long as you don't share the private seed and don't lose it.</p> 

<b>When should I move to Cold Storage?</b>

<p>There is no hard rule for when to move to cold storage, but it's usually said that when you have 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin in a hot wallet. Another option to know when to take the step is when you can't sleep at ease.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Hardware Wallet</h4>

<p>The key is that your private keys never touch the internet, making them immune to online hacks. A hardware wallet or a Cold wallet is a device that will generate our wallet seed offline, this way it will grant maximum security to our Bitcoin.</p>

<p>There are different options for your Hardware Wallet (ColdCard, BitBox02, Trezor, Jade. Avoid Ledger), each one of them has a different price, and sometimes different specifications. The best idea is to find something that is airgapped, so we can create out seed completely offline. In this case I will explain how to set up the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/mk4"><b>ColdCard Mk4</b></a>.</p>

<h4>Baking up your seed phrase with metal plates</h4>
<p>.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Sparrow Wallet</h4>
<p>Install Sparrow, verify it, intiial setup</p>
<p>Import your wallet from the hardware wallet</p>

<h4>Sending your first transaction</h4>
<p>Receive sats from your hot wallet to the RECEIVE Sparrow option</p>
<p>Send sats from your cold wallet to the SEND bluewallet option (it's needed to sign the transaction offline with a ColdCard. Important concept: airgapped)</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
