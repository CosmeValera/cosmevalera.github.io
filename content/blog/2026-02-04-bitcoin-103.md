<b>What is Cold Storage?</b>

<p>Cold storage is the practice of securing Bitcoin offline, away from internet-connected devices and potential hackers. It's the standard for protecting significant amounts of Bitcoin you plan to hold long-term.</p>

<p>As we saw in <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-102/"><b>BTC 102: How to Buy Bitcoin Securely</b></a>, a hot wallet is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated online, it's convenient, but also potentially vulnerable. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated offline, and where the seed phrase has never been exposed to any online device, thus it is immune to online hacks. However, this security comes with responsibility: your Bitcoin is only safe as long as you don't share the private seed and don't lose it.</p> 

<b>When should I move to Cold Storage?</b>

<p>There is no hard rule for when to move to cold storage, but it's usually said that you should consider it when you have around 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hardware wallets cost around 100-250 euros, plus the cost of a backup system for your seed phrase. If you only have 100 euros in Bitcoin, the investment may not be justified yet. However, some people prefer the peace of mind of going cold storage from the beginning, it's a matter of personal preference. A good rule of thumb: if you're losing sleep worrying about your Bitcoin security, it's time to move to cold storage.</p>

<h4>Setting up a Hardware Wallet</h4>

<p>A hardware wallet is a device that generates our wallet seed offline, this way it grants maximum security to our Bitcoin.</p>

<p>There are different options for your Hardware Wallet (ColdCard, BitBox02, Trezor, Jade), each one of them has a different price and sometimes different specifications. I recommend using ColdCard, either the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/mk4"><b>ColdCard Mk4</b></a> (around 150 euros) which is the device I'll use for this tutorial, or pay a little bit more to have a bigger screen and buttons: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/q"><b>ColdCard Q</b></a> (around 250 euros). Both options are great.</p>

        <p>There are other good options like the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://bitbox.swiss/bitbox02/"><b>BitBox02</b></a> (around 150 euros), the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://foundation.xyz/passport-core/"><b>Passport</b></a> (around 200 euros), or the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.trezor.io/"><b>Trezor Safe 7</b></a> (around 250 euros).</p>

<p>Let's go through the process of setting up our hardware wallet, we will also see how to backup our seed phrase with metal plates and how to use Sparrow to manage our cold wallet.</p>

<h4>Backing up your seed phrase with metal plates</h4>

<p>Using metal plates is the most secure way to backup your seed phrase, as it's impossible to hack metal plates and it lasts over time. Writing down your seed phrase in a piece of paper is not secure, as it can be stolen, lost or get damaged over time.</p>

<p>We need to backup our seed phrase with metal plates, to do so we will use the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/"><b>OneKey KeyTag</b></a> (around 60 euros). </p>

    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>There are other options to store your seed phrase in metal plates like <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.blockplate.com/"><b>Blockplate</b></a>, <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://getcoinplate.com/?v=12470fe406d4"><b>Coinplate Alpha</b></a> and <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://seedplate.com/"><b>Seedplate</b></a>.</p>

        </div>
        <p>As well as other methods to store your seed phrase like writing it down instead of punching the metal plate using <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://ironhodl.com/"><b>IRON HODL</b></a> or <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://oz-usa.com/ti1000-lite-titanium-crypto-seed-phrase-recovery-cold-storage-system-metal-plate-engraving-pen/"><b>TI1000</b></a>.</p>

        <p>Any of these options work, the most important thing is to have a durable backup of your seed phrase. Feel free to compare prices and specifications.</p>

<h4>Setting up Sparrow Wallet</h4>
<!-- <p>Install Sparrow, verify it, intiial setup</p>
<p>Import your wallet from the hardware wallet</p> -->

<p>Install <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/"><b>Sparrow Wallet</b></a> in your computer. Sparrow Wallet is an open-sourced and non-custodial desktop wallet especially designed for cold storage of Bitcoin.</p>

<p>You can follow this tutorial to install Sparrow Wallet:</p>

<h4>Sending your first transaction</h4>
<p>Receive sats from your hot wallet to the RECEIVE Sparrow option</p>
<p>Send sats from your cold wallet to the SEND bluewallet option (it's needed to sign the transaction offline with a ColdCard. Important concept: airgapped)</p>

All text:
  - When to make the move from hot to cold storage
    - Important to mention at the start that it's important to start small based on what is said in BTC 102, and wait several months before going Cold Storage.
    - Regarding when someone should start in cold storage: it's usually said that when you have 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin in a hot wallet. Another option to know when to take the step is when you can't sleep at ease.
  - Hot vs cold wallet differences (it's been already covered in 102, maybe mention again, to make it even more clear that cold wallets bring a 100% safety as long as you do everything correctly: don't share the private seed and don't lose it)
