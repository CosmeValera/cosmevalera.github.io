<b>Why should I care about Cold Storage?</b>

<p>People have lost hundreds of millions in Bitcoin. These are the most common reasons:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Lost seed phrase:</b> <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74zel3ng1vo">James Howells</a> accidentally threw away a hard drive containing 8,000 Bitcoin (now worth over 700 million euros) in 2013.</li>
    <li><b>Scams or phishing attacks:</b> <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://heraldsheets.com/protocol-podcast-host-loses-bitcoin-btc-savings/">Eric Savics</a> lost 7 years of savings (over 1 million euros in Bitcoin) in 20 minutes after downloading a fake wallet app.</li>
    <li><b>Exchange hacks/collapse:</b> The <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.investopedia.com/what-went-wrong-with-ftx-6828447">FTX collapse</a> in 2022 left customers unable to access billions in Bitcoin they stored on the exchange.</li>
    <li><b>Death without an inheritance plan:</b> Family members unable to <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.swanbitcoin.com/education/multi-sig-custody-and-inheritance/">access Bitcoin after the owner's death</a>, lost forever.</li>
</ul>

<p>The pattern: Most losses are from not having proper backups or giving up custody to third parties. This is why cold storage is essential, especially when you have a significant amount of Bitcoin.</p>

<b>What is Cold Storage?</b>

<p>Cold storage is the practice of securing Bitcoin offline, away from internet-connected devices and potential hackers. It's the standard for protecting significant amounts of Bitcoin you plan to hold long-term.</p>

<p>As we saw in <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://cosmevalera.dev/blog/bitcoin-102/"><b>BTC 102: How to Buy Bitcoin Securely</b></a>, a hot wallet is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated online, it's convenient, but also potentially vulnerable. A cold wallet, on the other hand, is a wallet that has had its seed phrase generated offline, and where the seed phrase has never been exposed to any online device, thus it is immune to online hacks. However, this security comes with responsibility: your Bitcoin is only safe as long as you don't share the private seed and don't lose it.</p> 

<b>When should I move to Cold Storage?</b>

<p>There is no hard rule for when to move to cold storage, but it's usually said that you should consider it when you have around 2 salaries invested in Bitcoin.</p>

<p>Hardware wallets cost around 100-250 euros, plus the cost of a backup system for your seed phrase (around 50-100 euros). If you only have 100 euros in Bitcoin, the investment may not be justified yet. However, some people prefer the peace of mind of going cold storage from the beginning, it's a matter of personal preference. A good rule of thumb: if you're losing sleep worrying about your Bitcoin security, it's time to move to cold storage.</p>

<!-- The following disclaimer needs an emoji: -->
> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** I'm not being sponsored by any company. To have cold storage you will need to buy both a hardware wallet and a backup system for your seed phrase. Therefore, my recommendations are only based on my personal experience and what I think is the best option for you.

<p>In this tutorial, I'll guide you through choosing a hardware wallet and seed backup system, creating your first cold wallet with the hardware wallet, and using Sparrow to send and receive Bitcoin.</p>

<h4>Hardware Wallet</h4>

<p>A hardware wallet is a physical device that generates and stores your wallet seed offline, creating what's known as a cold wallet. This way it grants maximum security to our Bitcoin. </p>

<p>The device allows you to sign transactions offline before broadcasting them to the network, ensuring your private keys never leave the secure environment of the hardware wallet, even when sending Bitcoin. Modern hardware wallets also offer additional security features, which won't be covered in this tutorial but are worth learning about on your own, such as: temporary seeds, passphrases, multi-signature support, etc.</p>

<p>There are different options for your hardware wallet (ColdCard, BitBox02, Trezor, Jade), each one of them has a different price and sometimes different specifications. I recommend using ColdCard, either the <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/mk4"><b>ColdCard Mk4</b></a> (around 150 euros) which is the device I'll use for this tutorial, or pay a little bit more to have a bigger screen and more buttons: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://coldcard.com/q"><b>ColdCard Q</b></a> (around 250 euros). Both options are great.</p>

<p>Let's go through the process of setting up our hardware wallet, we will also see how to backup our seed phrase with metal plates and how to use Sparrow to manage our cold wallet.</p>

---

<h4>Seed phrase backup</h4>

<p>Using metal plates is the most secure way to backup your seed phrase. Metal plates are impossible to hack and they last over time. Writing down your seed phrase in a piece of paper is not secure in the long term, as it can be stolen, lost or or damaged by water or fire.</p>

<p>To backup your seed phrase with metal plates, I recommend buying: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/"><b>OneKey KeyTag</b></a> (around 60 euros). This product consists of 2 metal plates and a punch pen to record your seed phrase (you can store up to two different seed phrases). </p>

    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>There are other options to store your seed phrase in metal plates like <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.blockplate.com/"><b>Blockplate</b></a>, <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://getcoinplate.com/?v=12470fe406d4"><b>Coinplate Alpha</b></a> and <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://seedplate.com/"><b>Seedplate</b></a>.</p>

          <img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2026-02-04-bitcoin-3/image-6.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>You can also use engraving methods instead of punching, such as <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://ironhodl.com/"><b>IRON HODL</b></a> or <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://oz-usa.com/ti1000-lite-titanium-crypto-seed-phrase-recovery-cold-storage-system-metal-plate-engraving-pen/"><b>TI1000</b></a>.</p>

          <img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2026-02-04-bitcoin-3/image-4.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>I recommend <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://onekey.so/products/onekey-keytag/"><b>OneKey KeyTag</b></a> because it's one of the most affordable options, includes 2 plates and a punch pen, and is both durable and easy to use.</p>
        <p>Any of these options work, the most important thing is to have a durable backup of your seed phrase. Feel free to compare prices and specifications.</p>

<h4>MicroSD card and Adapter</h4>

<p>If you use a ColdCard, you need to buy a microSD card to store the wallet export from the ColdCard, and an adapter to connect the microSD card to your computer. You can find these on Amazon or any electronics retailer. Here are examples: <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08TJTB8XS?ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_ss_BEKAHX6Q2PQT6W7YVK76"><b>MicroSD</b></a> and <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B09NHKN74L?ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_wa_apan_dp_ss_M728Z6W1VP4NPY6KB576"><b>Adapter</b></a>.</p>

<div class="phone-images-row">
  <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B08TJTB8XS?ref_=cm_sw_r_cso_cp_apan_dp_ss_BEKAHX6Q2PQT6W7YVK76" target="_blank">
    <img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2026-02-04-bitcoin-3/image-7.png"></img>

    <img class="phone-image" src="/images/blog/2026-02-04-bitcoin-3/image-8.png"></img>
  </a>
</div>

<p>For the following sections, we assume you have purchased the hardware wallet, the metal plate backup, and (if using ColdCard) the microSD card and adapter. If you're using a different hardware wallet, the process will be similar but the exact steps may vary.</p>

<h4>Installing Sparrow Wallet</h4>

<p>Install <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/"><b>Sparrow Wallet</b></a> on your computer. Sparrow is an open-source and non-custodial desktop wallet especially designed for cold storage of Bitcoin. It's what most Bitcoiners use to manage their hardware wallets.</p>

<p>The initial setup is straightforward:</p>

- Install <a class="link-text" target="_blank" href="https://sparrowwallet.com/download/"><b>Sparrow Wallet</b></a>
- [Introduction] **Click Next**
- [Public Server] **Click Next**
- [Bitcoin Core node] **Click Next**
- [Connecting to a Private Electrum Server] **Configure Server**
- **Click Test Connection**
- If it says "Connected to Electrum": **Click Create New Wallet**
  - If it failed, pick another Public Server URL and try again
- **Now Sparrow Wallet is set up!** 

<p>We'll import your cold wallet from the hardware wallet in the next steps. For now, Sparrow is ready and waiting.</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Video guide for Sparrow setup (first 4 minutes)</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
        <p>This video covers the Sparrow setup process (00:46-03:44). The rest of the video demonstrates hot wallet features and an alternative cold storage setup method, which you can explore if interested, but we'll be using the air-gapped method with ColdCard in the following sections.</p>

<h4>Hardware Wallet setup</h4>

<p>Now it's time to create your first cold wallet using the ColdCard. Follow along with the steps below, or if you prefer video instructions, watch the 7-minute tutorial:</p>

<details class="expandable-info">
    <summary><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> 7-minute video tutorial: Setting up the ColdCard Mk4</summary>
    <div class="expandable-content">
      <iframe width="100%" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-HbVnQphY0?si=_lG40LygWkR-ukqT" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    </div>
</details>

<p>Here are the steps:</p>

- Unpack the ColdCard Mk4 (it comes with a serial number card and a temporary wallet backup card)
- Plug the ColdCard into a power source (preferably a wall outlet rather than your computer)
- Verify that the serial number on the device matches the one on the package card
- Follow the on-screen tutorial to set up your ColdCard PIN and store it on the backup card
- Select "New Seed Words" to generate your first cold wallet
- Write down the seed words on the backup card and complete the verification quiz
- Once complete, your ColdCard will display "Ready to Sign" as the first menu option

<p>Congratulations! Your ColdCard is now ready to sign transactions offline 🥳</p>

<p>Before we use it, there's one critical step: moving your seed phrase from the temporary backup card to the permanent metal plate.</p>

---

<h4>Backup your seed phrase in metal</h4>

<p>The backup card that came with your ColdCard is only meant for temporary storage during setup. Now we'll transfer your seed phrase to a permanent, fireproof, and waterproof metal backup.</p>

    </div>
</details>

<p><b>Creating your metal backup:</b></p>

- Unpack the OneKey KeyTag (includes two metal plates, a punch pen, and instructions)
- Use the punch pen to carefully punch the holes corresponding to each word of your seed phrase
- Double-check your work (each word must be punched correctly)
- Optional: Add an NFC chip to store a note (like "Bitcoin wallet backup")
- Optional: Apply the tamper-evident seal (wait until after you've verified the backup works)

<p><b>⚠️ Critical security steps:</b></p>

- **Never photograph** your seed words or backup card
- **Don't let anyone see** your seed phrase while you're working
- Once you've punched the metal plate, **burn or shred** the paper backup card completely

<p><b>Verify your backup before destroying the paper:</b></p>

Before destroying the backup card, it's wise to test your metal backup. You can do this by temporarily deleting your wallet from Sparrow and restoring it using only the metal plate. This ensures that if you ever need to recover your wallet years from now, you'll be able to. Don't wait 10 years to discover your backup doesn't work!

<p><b>Store your metal plate securely:</b></p>

<p>Your metal plate is now the master key to your Bitcoin. Anyone who finds it can access your funds. Consider storing it in a home safe or other secure location. Remember: the ColdCard stores the wallet in its secure element, so for day-to-day use you won't need the metal plate, it's only for recovery if your ColdCard is lost or damaged.</p>

<p>Now that your cold wallet is secured and backed up, let's learn how to use it with Sparrow to send and receive Bitcoin!</p>

<h4>Next Steps</h4>
<p>.</p>

```js
Summary:

NEW: 
PASO 1 (Hardware Wallet setup):
- Sparrow está seteado
- Ahora hay que setear la ColdCard mk4 (esto dependerá de cada hardware wallet) para poder generar la cold wallet con ella.
- Creo que con la coldcard, te viene un papel con instrucciones, para seteear los primeros digitos que sirven como contraseña para acceder a la coldcard, así como unos huequitos para poner nuestra primera wallet
- Crear una wallet nueva en la coldcard mk4 (se pueden tirar dados para aumentar entropía)
- Escribir las palabras en papel (y pasar el mini examen de la coldcard mk4)
- Escribir las palabras en metal
- Usando la coldcard, usar opción: 'export wallet' (especificar que esa opción: exporta el xpub ese, no exporta las 12/24 palabras, eso nunca sale del dispositivo)
- Usar la tarjeta microSD, para pasar ese fichero con la wallet exportada de la coldcard al portatil
- Ya tenemos la Wallet en el portatil !!

PASO 2 (destroy backup card, write on metal plate):
- Las palabras en el metal nos van a servir para que nuestra cold wallet (dirección de Bitcoin) esté segura, en caso de que se rompiera nuestra hardware wallet. Importante comprobar que todo lo hemos puesto bien, llegando incluso a probar a escribir las palabras que nos genera desde la placa de metal, para ver después si coincide con las palabras que tenemos en el papel. Así podemos estar 100% seguros de que si el día de mañana tuvieramos que hacer uso de la placa de metal, podríamos recuperar la wallet).
- Importante también en todo el proceso, expresar la importancia de no tomar ninguna foto, ni dejar que nadie tome ninguna foto ni copie nuestras palabras que estamos escribiendo temporalmente en el papel
- Cuando esté todo comprobado de que lo que hemos guardado en la placa de metal se corresponde con nuestra wallet en el papel, procederemos a quemar o a eliminar sin dejar ningún tipo pde rastro de nuestra clave en el papel (al igual que de la copia si la hubieramos creado para comprobar la clave), al final solo tiene que quedar la clave grabada en la placa de metal.
- En la placa de metal se puede añadir un chip NFC (que con una aplicacción se puede leer desde el movil) y ese nfc podemos ponerle quien es el dueño o lo que queramos. Al igual que también podemos ponerle un parche antistamp ( o como se llame), que es muy útil para saber que cuando volvamos a ver la pieza de metal en el futuro saber que nadie lo ha abierto (una vez lo abres no puedes volver a ponerlo sin dejar marcas de haberlo roto).
- El último paso, es encontrar un lugar seguro donde dejarlo, plantearse comprar algún safe o algún fuerte para gaurdar hay la pieza de metal con las palabras.
- Lo bueno es que la coldcard guarda dentro de su zona segura una wallet, así que en el día a día, no nos hará falta el metal, mientras no se nos rompa la coldcard.

PASO 3 (send sats to cold wallet):
- Una vez ya tenemos el metal con la frase semilla. Y la coldcard configurada y disponible. 
- Exportamos la wallet al portatil si no lo habiamos hecho ya.
- Ahora primero podemos mandar sats, con la opción de receive de la wallet en sparrow, le mandamos unos sats que tengamos en nuestro hot wallet (bluewallet por ejemplo)
- Si todo va bien, deberían llegar los sats

PASO 4 (send sats from cold wallet to hot wallet):
- Ahora vamos a enviar esos sats que nos han llegado, de vuelta a nuestra hot wallet
- Para ello tenemos que pinchar al botón de SEND en Sparrow. 
- Añadir el address de la hot wallet (botón RECEIVE en BlueWallet)
- Seleccionar fee (bajo si no te importa esperar, comprobar estado de la mempool).
- Pinchar en crear transacción
- Para que la transacción se pueda hacer necesitaremos una firma desde nuestra cold wallet.
- Pinchamos en SAVE transaction, para meterla en nuestra tarjeta microSD en el ordenador
- Sacamos la microSD y la metemos en la coldcard. Entonces tenemos que seleccionar la opción "READY TO SIGN", ver que todo está bien, y aceptar para firmarla
- De esta forma la coldcard creará un fichero con la firma en la microSD.
- LLevamos la microSD al portatil de nuevo, en la pantalla de SPARROW pinchamos a LOAD transaction, y seleccionamos en la carpeta de la microSD, el fichero que ponga el nombre de la transacción, y acabe con '-signed.json'. 
- Una vez selecconiado ese fichero, si todo va bien, Sparrow, debería mostrar como que la transacción ya tiene la firma que necesitaba y que ya se puede mandar
- Pinchar botón de "Broadcast transaction", para terminar de ejecutarla
- Ahora hace falta esperar a que sea incluida en un bloque, pero ya hemos conseguido recibir y mandar sats con nuestra Sparrow Wallet!! De esta forma conseguimos tener acceso a nuestros fondos en cold storage y con una metodología air gappeed, asegurandonos que nuestra clave semilla nunca toca ningún dispositivo conectado a internet, de esta forma evitando posibles hackeos o robos!!

PASO 5 (Learn more):
Cosas interesantes a partir de aquí->
- Descubrir diferentes opciones que tiene la coldcard (o el dispositivo que hayas elegido):
  - Wallet falsa por si te intentan robar en persona
  - Passphrase, que es como añadir una palabra 13 o 25 (aunque también requiere de buscar la forma para tampooco perderla)
  - Multisig 2-3, para cuando tengas cantidades incluso más grandes y quieras tener redundnacia, para que si se te quema la casa no pierdas todo tu patrimonio, aunque esto también involucra un mayor plan y organización
  - Temas de herencia: Time lock, multisig, etc
  - Investigar tema de Bitcoin Lightning, para que sirve y como montartelo y tal (muun vs alby)
  Las opciones son casi infiinitas, Bitcoin es dinero programable, y se pueden hacer muchas cosas con el.



* Hay que añadir en algún sitio del principio que hay que comprar una microSD card y un mini adaptador de USB a microSD
