<h4><b>🏷️ Valuation Metrics</b></h4>

**1️⃣ Market Cap**

**Definition:** The total value of a company.

**Formula:** `Market Cap = Share Price × Shares`  
- Tells you if a company is large or small.

**2️⃣ Enterprise Value (EV)**

**Definition:** A more complete measure than Market Cap, as it includes debt and cash.  
**Formula:** `EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash`  
- EV is like the price you'd pay to buy the whole company, including its debts.
- Debt is added because when buying a company, you take on its obligations too.
> If the `EV` is much higher than the `Market Cap`, that's a bad sign because it means the company has a lot of debt.

**3️⃣ Trailing P/E (Price/Earnings, last 12 months)**

**Definition:** Ratio of price to earnings over the past year.

Lower is generally better, since that means that the earnings are greater.
> Typically, a Trailing P/E below 17 suggests the stock may be undervalued; while above 18 could indicate overvaluation (though this varies by sector and company).

**4️⃣ Forward P/E (Price/Earnings, next 12 months)**

**Definition:** Ratio of price to expected future earnings over the coming year.
- If Forward P/E is **lower** than Trailing P/E, **worse** results are expected.
- If Forward P/E is **higher** than Trailing P/E, **better** results are expected. 

**5️⃣ EV/EBITDA**

This might be the single most important metric, so hold on a second. It may sound complicated at first, but once it clicks, it’s actually pretty intuitive.
- **Definition:** EV/EBITDA is the ratio of Enterprise Value (EV) to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA).
- To make it easy: **EV** is the company's total value and **EBITDA** is its operating benefits (before taxes and other stuff). So, you can think of it as the **company's price divided by its operating benefits**.
- This metric tells you how many years it would take for the company to pay off its current valuation using its operating earnings.
> For example, a EV/EBITDA of 10 means that the company would take 10 years to pay its current valoration (e.g., company is valued in $100M and generates $10M per year)

**How to interpret EV/EBITDA**
> A value **below 10** might suggest the company is undervalued or a potentially good buy. But be careful, it can also mean the company is in trouble or that investors lack confidence in its future.
> 
> A value **above 10** could indicate the company is overvalued, or it might be seen as so innovative or promising that investors believe it deserves a premium price.

<h4><b> 💰 Profitability</b></h4>

**6️⃣ Profit Margin**

- Measures how much profit a company makes from its revenue.
- The higher, the better.
- However, margins vary a lot by industry
  - Supermarkets have low margins (~2%)
  - Tech companies can have exceed 20%.  
> As a general rule of thumb:
> - 5–10% = Average
> - 10–20% = Good
> - \>20% = Excellent

<h4><b> 📈 Income Statement</b></h4>

**7️⃣ EBITDA Growth**

- Look for positive and growing EBITDA.

**8️⃣ Earnings Growth**

- Consistent growth in earnings is a positive sign.

---

<h4><b> 🏦 Balance Sheet</b></h4>

**9️⃣ Total Cash**

- The more, the better.

**🔟 Total Debt**

- The less, the better.
- Check if the company can pay its debt with EBITDA. Fewer years to pay off debt is better.

---

<h4><b> 📉 Stock Price History</b></h4>

**1️⃣1️⃣ Beta**

- Measures correlation of the stock's returns with the market.
  - **<1:** Defensive (less volatile)
  - **=1:** Neutral (moves with the market)
  - **>1:** Aggressive (more volatile)
- Example: If Beta = 2, and the market rises 100, the stock rises 200 (and vice versa).

<h4><b> 📊 Insider Statistics</b></h4>

**1️⃣2️⃣ % of Shares Held by Insiders**

- The higher, the better. You want management to have skin in the game.

---

<h4><b> 💸 Dividends</b></h4>

**1️⃣3️⃣ Dividend Yield and Payout**

- Check the dividend yield and how sustainable it is.
- Example: A 5% yield means you get $5 per $100 invested each year.

<h4><b>📝 Conclusion</b></h4>

Looking at all the metrics will give you a clearer, more objective view of a company's value, profitability, and risk. Remember, no single metric tells the whole story.

That said, a good tip for beginners: the two most important metrics to focus on are `EV/EBITDA` and `P/E`.
