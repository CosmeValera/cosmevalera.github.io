<h4><b>How to Analyze a Stock</b></h4>

Analyzing a stock can seem overwhelming, but by breaking it down into key metrics, you can make informed decisions. Here's a practical guide based on proven valuation and profitability measures.

## 🏷️ Valuation Metrics

### 1️⃣ Market Cap
**Definition:** The total value of a company.  
**Formula:**  
`Market Cap = Share Price × Shares Outstanding`  
- Tells you if a company is large or small.

### 2️⃣ Enterprise Value (EV)
**Definition:** A more complete measure than Market Cap, as it includes debt and subtracts cash.  
**Formula:**  
`EV = Market Cap + Debt - Cash`  
- EV is like the price you'd pay to buy the whole company, including its debts.

### 3️⃣ Trailing P/E (Price/Earnings, last 12 months)
- Ratio of price to earnings over the past year.
- Lower is generally better. A P/E below 17 is considered undervalued; above 18 may be overvalued.

### 4️⃣ Forward P/E (Price/Earnings, next 12 months)
- Ratio of price to expected future earnings.
- If Forward P/E is higher than Trailing, worse results are expected. If lower, better results are expected.

### 5️⃣ EV/EBITDA
- Ratio of Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.
- Shows how many years it would take to pay off the company's value with its operating earnings.
- A value below 8 is good, above 10 is high.

## 💰 Profitability

### 6️⃣ Profit Margin
- Measures how much profit a company makes from its revenue.
- Higher is better. Supermarkets have low margins (~2%), tech companies can have >20%.  
- In general, 5–10% is average, 10–20% is good, >20% is excellent.

---

## 📈 Income Statement

### 7️⃣ EBITDA Growth
- Look for positive and growing EBITDA.

### 8️⃣ Earnings Growth
- Consistent growth in earnings is a positive sign.

---

## 🏦 Balance Sheet

### 9️⃣ Total Cash
- The more, the better.

### 🔟 Total Debt
- The less, the better.
- Check if the company can pay its debt with EBITDA. Fewer years to pay off debt is better.

---

## 📉 Stock Price History

### 1️⃣1️⃣ Beta
- Measures correlation of the stock's returns with the market.
  - **<1:** Defensive (less volatile)
  - **=1:** Neutral (moves with the market)
  - **>1:** Aggressive (more volatile)
- Example: If Beta = 2, and the market rises 100, the stock rises 200 (and vice versa).

---

## 📊 Insider Statistics

### 1️⃣2️⃣ % of Shares Held by Insiders
- The higher, the better. You want management to have skin in the game.

---

## 💸 Dividends

### 1️⃣3️⃣ Dividend Yield and Payout
- Check the dividend yield and how sustainable it is.
- Example: A 5% yield means you get $5 per $100 invested each year.

## 📝 Conclusion

By systematically reviewing these metrics, you can get a clear, objective view of a company's value, profitability, and risk. Remember, no single metric tells the whole story—combine them for a well-rounded analysis!
