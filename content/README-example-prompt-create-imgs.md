I want a blog post image, for this post about "shared styles in monorepos", the image preferably to be related with the post information, and make it studio ghibli style, and also longer in the x axis than the y axis. Please mention in the image with text some headers, so this cover post image can serve as a peek or preview of the content of the post (YOU MUST NOT include the title nor the description texts in the image, only the headers). These are the title and description of the post: "Shared Styles in Monorepos
Approaches to maintain consistent styles across multiple projects in a monorepo environment". And these are the headers: "ðŸ“¦ 1. Creating a Styles Library with npm", "ðŸ”— 2. Direct Import from a Centralized Directory"
